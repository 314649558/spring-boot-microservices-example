# Cloud Native Progressive Web Apps with Spring Boot and Angular

**Prerequisites**: Java 8 and Node.js

To run the client and all the servers, execute `./run.sh`, or execute the commands in this file individually.

To see how to develop the Angular client, see [Progressive Web Applications with Angular, Spring Boot, and Stormpath](https://stormpath.com/blog/progressive-web-applications-angular-spring-boot-stormpath). 

**NOTE:** This example doesn't require Stormpath since 
[Stormpath is joining forces with Okta](https://stormpath.com/blog/stormpaths-new-path) and you can't register for a new account. You can run this example without a Stormpath account.
